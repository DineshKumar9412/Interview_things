AI  vs  ML  vs  DL 
Artificial intelligence
**********************
	Enable the machine to think any human intervention. The machine will able to take its own decision called Artificial intelligence

Machine Learning 
*******************
	statistical tools to explore the data
	Machine Learning help us to do it provides us statistical tool statistical tool to explore the data
	 	 #  supervise Learning           
				will be having some label data  Ex: past data
		 #  unsupervised Learning 
				clustering the data   Ex: that based similarity to group that data      Mathematical concepts euclidean distance 
		 #  Reinforcement Learning  ——  semi supervise 
				some data’s are labelled and data not labelled 

Deep Learning 
***************
		Deep learning is a subset of machine learning how we learning with the help of our human brain Learn thing 
		deep Learning to mimic human brain 
		Multiple Neural-network architecture 
		Ann (artificial neural network)               most of data present form of numbers 
		cnn  (convolution neural network )       form of input link image 
		Rnn  (recurrent neural network )           form of data input link time series

Pandas
********
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the python programming language

Creating a DataFrame
	data = {'Name': ['Tom', 'nick', 'Krishna, 'jack'],
        'Age': [20, 21, 19, 18]}
	df = pd.DataFrame(data)
Slicing a DataFram
        loc                    =====>>  row based filter  ex: result = df.loc[‘row_2, 'Name']
	iloc                   =====>>  row index label of a data frame  ex: data.iloc[4:8]

Axis = 1

Missing Data
		drop all elements 
				df.dropna(axis = 1) == axis 1 = column  axis 0 == row
	
		isnull()    notnull()    dropna()      fillna()      replace()     interpolate()

Groupby
	df.groupby('Team')
	df.groupby(['Team', 'Position'])
	df.groupby("state")["last_name"].count()
	df.groupby(["state", "gender"])["last_name”].reset_index()
	df.groupby(["state", "gender"], as_index=False)["last_name”] df.groupby("state", sort=False)["last_name"]	

Pandas merge/join
	concat two dataframe
	pd.concat([df1, df2])
	pd.merge(left, right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None,
left_index=False, right_index=False, sort=True)

Pandas Statistics
